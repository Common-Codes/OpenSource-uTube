> YouTube, but it's open source, and completely Google **Monetisation** free

## How it works:
### Dependencies:

- [firebase/auth, firebase/firestore, firebase/storage & firebase/rules](https://firebase.google.com) - 'Cloud', API storage and Account Authority
- [Self-Hosted Plausible](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting) - Completely anonymous site statistics

### Storage Bukkets:
#### Video
- [firebase/storage](https://firebase.google.com) 10G Free additional Cloud Storage (above the 15G already provided)
- AP1/V1RU5 - V1RU5's up-until-now unused VPS
- [Discord](https://discord.com) - [Join the server](https://discord.com/invite/Wh2zxEfYaB) to find out more

#### Image

### Some description:
- Upload content.
- It gets compressed af, then stored on a Video Storage Bukket.
- Whenever someone wants to view said content, it gets decompressed live.
(this may cause issues, such as excessive buffering. also this keeps the original upload quality somehow.)
