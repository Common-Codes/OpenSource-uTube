### Some description:
- Upload content.
- It gets compressed af, then stored on a Video Storage Bukket.
- Whenever someone wants to view said content, it gets decompressed live.
(this may cause issues, such as excessive buffering. also this keeps the original upload quality somehow.)


If you want to fork this repo, feel free, it's Open Source for a reason.
