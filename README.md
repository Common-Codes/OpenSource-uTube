# Common-Codes' OpenSource-uTube fork.
> YouTube, but it's open source, and completely Google **Monetisation** free

## How it works:
### Dependencies:
- [utubei](https://Common-Codes.github.io/utubei) The official uTube API
<!-- - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) Will this be used? -->
- [firebase/auth, firebase/firestore & firebase/rules](https://firebase.google.com) - 'Cloud' and Account Authority
- [verbose](https://verbose.crispychat.tech) Lightweight Image Proxy

### Storage Bukkets:
- [firebase/storage](https://firebase.google.com) 10G Free additional Cloud Storage (above the 15G already provided)
- VS1/V1RU5

### Some description:
- Upload content.
- It gets compressed af, then stored on a 'Cloud'.
- Whenever someone wants to view said content, it gets decompressed live.
(this may cause issues, such as excessive buffering)


If you want to fork this repo, feel free, it's Open Source for a reason.
